                          <p>NJB-WEC supports the development of and provides a forum to under privileged, disadvantaged and deprived young and adolescent girls, particularly those who do not have opportunities to go to school, have dropped out of the school and/or are normally not allowed to leave their homes . It also organizes special events and activities for children.</p>
                      <p>Preparatory and special meetings are organized with the women and young girls in different quarters of the village for information about the aims and objectives of the Centre, its activities, awareness, motivation and the need for these girls to join the centreâ€™s activities.</p>
                      <p>Need based short training classes in personal grooming and hygiene, sewing , scholastic support and counseling for women victims of domestic violence are organized under the aegis of the centre. Talks and presentations on health and hygiene by special guests, cultural activities, celebrations and educational trips have been immensely popular and useful for the gradual but noticeable overall development of these girls.</p>
                      <p>Every year, a summer camp for the girls is organized where in addition to sewing and personal hygiene, special activity oriented sessions in basic jewellery making, basic home/financial accounting, basic first aid and henna art were organized. These activities not only provided a valuable forum for mutual sharing and support but the change in personal confidence of these girls has been phenomenal. </p>
                      <p>These programmes and activities are also having a positive impact on the income generating capacities and potentials for enhancing personal incomes of many of the girls.</p>
                      <p>In view of the success, growing acceptance and popularity of the Centre and its activities, it is planned to be expanded both in terms of the intake as well as additional activities.</p></div>
